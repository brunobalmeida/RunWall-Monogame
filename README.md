# RunWall-Monogame

Run Wall - Game for windows

Run wall is the final project for Object Oriented game course at Conestoga College. 
The requirements were: 
    * Build a game to run in windows; 
    * It could be a replica of an existing game. However, the programmer must've coded all the game by himself;
    * The game should have a menu with different options, including: 
          * Start Game
          * How to Play
          * High Score
          * Help
          * Credit
          * Quit

I decided to build a game that looked like the Android based game "Fire Up". It is not exactly a replica of Fire Up but the ideia is almost the same.

It is a good code to understand the concepts of Monogame, as well as some other advanced features. 

This repository contains: 

    * A folder called documentation, where you can find the Class diagram, and a word document summing up all the project 
    * A installer folder, where you can find the published version of the game
    * And finally a folder called "RunWall" that has the code itself. 
    
The main goal of this project was to teach programming in object oriented way. Game is a fun way to do that, and to make the concecpts of object oriented programming easier to understand. So, feel free to check and use the code for that meaning. If you have any question, or improving suggestion, just email me.
